Hi, I started using this recently and it's excellent. But I'm running into a frustrating problem. In one of my many pages that use this library, I need to have a button that simply inserts a small local image into the editor. I think I'm simply using `quill.clipboard.dangerouslyPasteHTML(""<img src=/myimage.png />"") ` I was told other than in this one case, we cannot allow images to be pasted. When I took out 'img' from the allowed list, this no longer works. It inserts it, but then when I read the text out of the editor, the image string is gone. I understand this is by design. But is there any way for me to allow an exception or to further refine the criteria? For example, a way to allow only an image with a special class or id or something in order to whitelist it, but otherwise not allow other images. Or is it all images or no images?. Is there any middle ground? Like if I could combine items in the allowed list to allow more refinement in what is excluded? eg: allowed: ['b', 'strong', 'img[id=myimage]'].... something along those lines. Thanks"

That would avoid the need to hard-code the credentials in the configuration file, or passing them in plain text through command line options (which may expose these credentials in the operating system process list for example).

I can download the source code from the game and compile it with Visual Studio to test the Pad in the debugger, but I'm not used to work with devices and I would like to know where can I look the values that the driver returns (I guess you get them from a function, but that function might be getting them wrong, I don't know).

That being said, the references below are from trunk. **Additional context** The current implementation of `z_unpend1_no_timeout` is [as follows](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/d2c71796afc17ae10763b16ad59de9e18831821c/kernel/include/ksched.h#L305). ```c struct k_thread *thread = z_find_first_thread_to_unpend(wait_q, NULL); if (thread != NULL) { z_unpend_thread_no_timeout(thread); } ``` Unfortunately, although both of these individual calls are protected internally by `sched_spinlock`, there is no guarantee that the combination of the two calls are atomic. This can result in catastrophic system-level behavior.

(P.S. there is also a rather suspect comment in `z_timer_expiration_handler`: ```c /* * Interrupts _DO NOT_ have to be locked in this specific * instance of thread unpending because a) this is the only * place a thread can be taken off this pend queue, and b) the * only place a thread can be put on the pend queue is at * thread level, which of course cannot interrupt the current * context. */ ``` ...is this actually the case in SMP mode? On a single core, sure, but this comment's logic does not apply if there are multiple cores so far as I can tell. At least not without additional considerations (e.g. if there's a lock in this chain that I'm missing that would prevent a concurrent call to `z_impl_k_timer_start`). In addition, `z_impl_k_timer_stop` also potentially takes items off of the pend queue, contradicting a), if I understand the code correctly.)"

It's an absolute life saver if you use the AWS console seriously! I currently use the plugin with 19 accounts, and when I open the extension I have two vertical scrollbars. One in the account list and one in the plugin popup itself. See the following screenshot: ![Screenshot_2020-10-08_09:45:41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2489598/95430521-281bb100-094c-11eb-9a9e-b6f607372e28.png) (Chromium 84, Plugin Version 2.0.5, Arch Linux, 4K Screen, 1.0x scaling) I fiddled around a bit in the developer console and came up with a fix by giving the outer `div` of the plugin a height of 100% so it fits inside the popup and then I used column flexbox for the `main` element (containing the search box and the account list) so they split up the available vertical space. This way the right scrollbar is gone and you only have the one on the left for the account list which is imho the best way to support long account lists. See the following screenshots for my fix and how the result looks: ![Screenshot_2020-10-08_09:59:40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2489598/95431695-e55ad880-094d-11eb-9b3a-ad79a156377f.png) ![Screenshot_2020-10-08_10:10:20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2489598/95432217-a7aa7f80-094e-11eb-8935-34943e3b167e.png) I'm far away from being a web designer, so I don't know if the changes I made have any unwanted side effects or break in other scenarios. But if this looks sane I can give it a shot and submit a proper PR. Best, Felix"

See https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve. - If this library has additional install steps, describe them (e.g., pod install? jetify? etc). - Either re-create the bug using the repository's example app or link to a GitHub repository with code that reproduces the bug. - Explain the steps we need to take to reproduce the issue: --> 1. Render `<Marker>`s with custom JSX markup/children with React Native `<Image>` tag inside (as opposed to using `image` or `icon` props on `<Marker>` directly) 2. Cause the said `<Marker>`s to render multiple times in large number. For example via rendering new Markers as user pans. Describe what you expected to happen: 1. Marker should render without increasing the memory Describe what actually happens: 1. Marker renders and as you render lots of them we can observe the unreleasing increase in the memory ## Reproducible sample code GitHub repo: https://github.com/chrisregner/rnmmarkerleak This is the `App.js` file for convenience: ``` import React, { memo, useCallback, useState } from 'react' import { Image, View } from 'react-native' import MapView, { Marker } from 'react-native-maps' import circleWhitePng from './circle-white.png' let pinId = 0 const App = () => { const [pins, setPins] = useState([]) const handleRegionChangeComplete = useCallback(({ latitude, longitude, latitudeDelta, longitudeDelta }) => { const newPins = [] for (let i = 1; i <= 20; i++) { for (let j = 1; j <= 20; j++) { const newPin = { id: pinId++, latitude: latitude - (latitudeDelta / 2) + ((latitudeDelta / 21) * i), longitude: longitude - (longitudeDelta / 2) + ((longitudeDelta / 21) * j), } newPins.push(newPin) } } setPins(newPins) }, []) return ( <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'red' }}> <MapView provider='google' style={{ flex: 1 }} mapType='satellite' initialRegion={{ latitude: 32.7767, longitude: -96.7970, latitudeDelta: .001, longitudeDelta: .001, }} onRegionChangeComplete={handleRegionChangeComplete} > {pins.map(pin => <CustomMarker key={pin.id} {...pin} />)} </MapView> </View> ) } export default App const CustomMarker = memo(coord => { const [shouldTrackViewChanges, setShouldTrackViewChanges] = useState(true) return ( <Marker coordinate={coord} tracksViewChanges={shouldTrackViewChanges} > <Image source={circleWhitePng} onLoad={() => {setShouldTrackViewChanges(false)}} fadeDuration={0} /> </Marker> ) }) ``` --- Btw. This is a very important library for lots of developers, thanks to everyone who spent/are spending time for this!"
